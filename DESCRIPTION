Description: This package utilizes the theory of economies  of  scale  and  scope  (developed by Baumol, Panzar, & Willig (1982)) to calculate the average output costs, economies of scale, and economies of scope for  different  types  of  multi-output production  industries. So far, this package can reproduce the estimates using FFCQ-M cost function (see Zhang, Worthington, and Hu (in press) for details). This package is currently hosted on Github.
